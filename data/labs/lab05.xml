        <p>The purpose of this lab is to help you explore and practice
            some of the view techniques, incorporating libraries and helpers,
            from lessons 5 and 6.</p>
        <p>There is no optional part for this lab. </p>
        <p>Suggestion: you may want to skim the slideshow first,
            before working your way through it.</p>

    <slide title="NEWSFLASH" layout="normal">

    <slide title="Lab Marking Guideline" layout="normal">
        <p>There are ten tasks to complete for the lab.</p>
        <p>Keeping things simple, I will award one mark each,
        even though some are more involved than others.</p>
        <p>
            <i>Commenting:</i> add comments sufficient to convince 
            the reader that you know what you are doing. 
            Inappropriate/inadequate comments will cost you up to two marks off.</p>
