        <p>This tutorial will walk you through converting a static HTML
            website into a CodeIgniter webapp.</p>
        <p>Suggestion: you may want to skim the slideshow first,
            before working your way through it.</p>

            <p>Fork the 
                <a href="https://github.com/comp4711/winter2015-lab02" target="_blank">lab starter</a>
                project, and clone it to your local system.
            </p>
            <p>You can clone it to any folder inside your htdocs, as long as
                you have a virtual host mapping to it for testing.
                I will assume "comp4711.local" for this writeup.</p>

            <p>I cloned mine to a "my-lab02" project/folder on my system.

            <p>You should see a "public" folder, which contains an entire

            <p>Assuming that your new project is mapped to "comp4711.local",
                then the URL "comp4711.local/public" should give you the
                homepage of the static site, shown right.</p>

            <p>The basic steps we will follow are shown to the right.
            </p>
            <p>This isn't the only way to do this job, but is one
                that makes sense. After each stage of the conversion,
                we should still have a working site.</p>
            <p>Er, it will behave like it is working, even though
                it won't be a proper webapp until we are done.</p>

                give you the "Welcome to CodeIgniter!" page.</p>

            <p>We can make trivial controllers for each of these,
                which simply load the corresponding "view".</p>
            <p>Fix application/controllers/Welcome.php (your homepage)
                to load the "welcome" view.</p>
            <p>Create similar controllers Gallery.php and About.php,

            <p>We can make trivial views for each of the static pages,
                by copying the static html files to our application/views
                folder, and renaming them to have a ".php" extension.
                Note that index.html would become welcome.php.</p>     
            <p>You may have to rename these using your file manager,
                if your IDE won't let you change the extension.</p>      
            <p>We no longer need the views/welcome_message.php.</p>

    <slide title="Fix our image links" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Examining views/welcome.php, you can see that the CSS, javascript
                and image references are to locations which used to be
                at the same folder level as the HTML files, but which are
                now inside the "public" folder.</p>
            <p>We can solve this by copying/moving those folders up
                one level, alongside "applications".</p>
            <p>A better practice is to keep your "assets" (like these)
                in a separate folder, which could be called "public" or
                "assets".</p>
            <p>For now, let's copy the folders up one level. We can address 
                the better practice in a later refactoring.</p>

        <div class="left">
            <p>Yay, our site *looks* better, but what about the menu? It still
                refers to the original HTML files.</p>
            <p>Fix this by changing the menu links to refer to our CI controllers
                instead. Apply this change to each of our three views.</p>
            <p>There will be noticeable visible change in the site, but the menu
                should now work as expected :)</p>
            <p>Notice that the homepage is referred to as just "/", and that
                each of the other references start with a slash.</p>
