        <p>This tutorial will walk you through converting a static HTML
            website into a CodeIgniter webapp.</p>

                project, and clone it to your local system.
            </p>
            <p>You can clone it to any folder inside your htdocs, as long as
                you have a virtual host mapping to it for testing.
                I will assume "comp4711.local" for this writeup.</p>

                that makes sense. After each stage of the conversion,
                we should still have a working site.</p>
            <p>Er, it will behave like it is working, even though
                it won't be a proper webapp until we are done.</p>

            <p>Our static site has 3 pages, index.html, gallery.html
                and about.html. We can make trivial controllers for each of these,
                which simply load the corresponding "view".</p>
            <p>Fix application/controllers/Welcome.php (your homepage)
                to load the "welcome" view. Create similar controllers Gallery.php and About.php,

        <div class="left">
            <p>We can make trivial views for each of the static pages,
                by copying the static html files to our application/views
                folder, and renaming them to have a ".php" extension.
                Note that index.html would become welcome.php.</p>     
            <p>You may have to rename these using your file manager,
                if your IDE won't let you change the extension.</p>

    <slide title="Fix Our Image Links" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Examining views/welcome.php, you can see that the image 
                references no longer work. 
                We can solve this by copying/moving those folders up
                one level, alongside "applications".</p>
            <p>A better practice is to keep your "assets" (like these)
                in a separate folder, which could be called "public" or
                "assets". We can address 
                the better practice in a later refactoring.</p>
            <p>For now, let's copy the folders up one level. </p>

    <slide title="Fix Our Menu" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Yay, our site *looks* better, but what about the menu? It still
                refers to the original HTML files. Fix this by changing the menu links to refer to our CI controllers
                instead. Apply this change to each of our three views.</p>
            <p>Notice that the homepage is referred to as just "/", and that
                each of the other references start with a slash.</p>

    <slide title="Build a Master View Template" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Eliminate duplicate code in our views by extracting
                the common opening and closing HTML into views/template.php.</p>
            <p>Let's do that, and add a placeholder, "{content}", which will
                get substituted appropriately in our next tutorial step.
                Add another placeholder, "{pagetitle}", for the page title.</p>
            <p>I would do this by copying the about view, renaming it
                to "template.php", and then zapping its middle.</p>

        <div class="left">
            <p>We can now eliminate the common opening and closing HTML
                from our three original views, leaving just the "meat".</p>

                together consistently, using our template.</p>
            <p>This will be similar to the one referenced in lesson 2,
                from the contacts sample webapp.
                Copy yours from the contacts project to core/MY_Controller.php
                inside your lab 2 project.</p>
            <p>Fix the menu to suit our app, and change the ['title']
                reference to ['pagetitle'], to match what we already setup in 
                our template.</p>

        <div class="left">
            <p>Modify our three controllers to extend our base controller,
                Application, instead of CI_Controller. </p>
            <p>In these controllers, instead of $this-&gt;load->view('x')
                we should set a view parameter instead, and invoke the
                render method of the base controller.</p>
            <p>$this-&gt;data['pagebody'] = 'x'; $this-&gt;render();</p>

    <slide title="What Do You Think Now?" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>We also need to copy the common_helper
                from the contacts starter, so we can use its build_menu function.</p>
            <p>We should autoload the common and url helpers, and the parser library,
                since they are used in Application.
            </p>
            <p>Looking better, although the
                image references are still hard-coded.
                We'll fix that next.</p>

                How convenient! It's like someone planned to use a database eventually :-/</p>
            <p>The first step is to create a database, and import the data/setup/images.sql
                script to create a table we can then use.</p>
            <p>In config/autoload.php, we should add the database library, 
                and in config/database.php you should adjust your settings for your
                system.</p>

    <slide title="Now We Can Add a Model" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>The contacts example had a base model, but that feels like
                overkill for this simple app. We only need two methods in
                our model: get all images, ordered properly, and get
                the three newest images.</p>
            <p>Of course, if you want a complete MY_Model in your starter
                app, for convenience, feel free to use that here.</p>
            <p>We just need a simple model, which I suggest calling "Images".
                It is used on most of our pages, hence is safe to autoload in
                our configuration.</p>

        <div class="left">
            <p>Instead of hard-coding image names like the original static site,
                we can generate the HTML for those programmatically, in our
                Gallery controller.</p>
            <p>We will need to add a suitable method to our Images model to
                provide all of the image data. Let's call it *all()*, and have 
                it return an array of images, in reverse posting order

            <p>Save this as views/_cell.php. The underscore at the
                front of the name reinforces that this is for internal
