    <slide title="Tutorial Goals" layout="normal">
        <p>This tutorial is meant to give you some practice using and extending
            a library and a helper, as described in lesson 6.</p>
        <p>I have prepared a starter webapp â€“ based on the "quotes" webapp you 
            saw and fixed earlier, in tutorial 3. The webapp is complete,
            showing the most recent quote on the homepage, and then a gallery when you
            drill down, but it is painfully boring. We will add some ratings to the
            individual quote presentations, as well as a simple maintenance
            component for the quotes.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Preparation" layout="normal">
        <p>I have prepared a 
            <a href="https://github.com/comp4711/winter2015-lab05" target="_blank">
                starter webapp</a>. The lab 5 starter, Quotes, 
            is meant to handle ordering in a small restaurant. 
        </p>
        <p>The webapp is fully functional as delivered, but painfully
            boring. You are going to spice it up a bit :)</p>
        <p>Fork the github project, and clone it locally to
            work with, the same as you have done with the previous tutorial.</p>

    <slide title="The End Result" layout="normal">
        <p>This is what the end result should look like, after fixing!</p>

    <slide title="Database Setup" layout="normal">
        <p>You will need to setup your webapp's database, using the 
            supplied script, <code>quotes-setup.sql</code>.
            Please name the database "quotes", so that your webapp will
            work without additional setup when I run it on my system.</p>
        <p>As part of the tutorial, you will add a few columns to the
            table, for ratings.</p>
    </slide>

    <slide title="The Database" layout="normal">
        <p>The database provided contains a single table, with a single
            field as the primary key. The model provided, <code>Quotes</code>,
            extends MY_Model, inheriting all of the CRUD methods we need.</p>
        <p>The quotes table has four columns:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>id</code> is a unique numeric identifier for a quote; it must be positive</li>
                <li>
                    <code>who</code> is the name of the person quoted; it cannot be blank, 
                    and has a maximum length of 64</li>
                <li>
                    <code>mug</code> is the filename of the author's picture; images are
                    stored in the <code>data</code> folder off of the document root;
                    filenames have a maximum length of 64</li>
                <li>
                    <code>what</code> is is the actual quoted text, of arbitrary length</li>
            </ul>

                linked back to the homepage, and the "View 'Em" menu link
                taking you to the "viewer" page.</p>
            <p>The quote shown is the most recently added, i.e. the one with the

            files.</p>
        <p>
            <code>config/autoload.php</code> needs to load the database library. 
            You can also load your three models here, or you can load 
            them in the constructors of any controllers that need them.</p>
        <p>
            <code>config/database.php</code> needs to reference the appropriate 
            database name, and MySQL username/password to work with them. 
            If you are using this at home, or elsewhere, with a different 
            username/password, then add a configuration subfolder with
            your settings, and "git ignore" it so it is not part of
            your repository. That would technically make your config
            <code>config/development/database.php</code>

        <p>
            <code>controllers/Welcome.php</code> ... 
            the loop at line 31 expects a variable <code>$completed</code> 
            to contain the order data, as an associative array. 
            Completed orders can be distinguished by their

                base models.

        <p>

            <code>$this-&gt;orders-&gt;highest()</code> gives the last order # used.<br/>
            I suggest setting <code>$order_num</code> to that plus 1.</p>

            <code>Active_record::create()</code> creates a new record.<br/>

            <p>The last part of the menu display is showing the order total in the title.
                The <code>models/Orders::total()</code> method (lines 20+) is 
                meant to handle that.
                In order to calculate the total for an order, 
                iterate over the items in an order. 
                For each, retrieve its corresponding menu item.

    <slide title="Order Model Needs Updating Too" layout="normal">
        <p>The order total is also a property in the orders table. 
            The writeup says it only has to be saved/accurate when an order 
            is completed. You could make a design decision to update the order 
            total whenever an item was added to an order, 
            in which case this step could be satisfied by getting 
            that property from the order. Regardless of your design decision, 
            you will need to complete the <code>Order::total()</code> 
            method at some point.</p>
        <p>However you calculate or get the order total, it needs to be 
            appended to the page title, inside parentheses. 
            It would be a good idea to format it nicely and consistently. 
            Any of the <code>money_format</code>, <code>number_format</code> 
            or <code>sprintf</code> functions,
            built-in to PHP , could do the trick.</p>

    <slide title="5. ADD QUOTE ADDITION" layout="normal">
        <p>Fix <code>controllers/Order:add()</code>. 
            It will need to use <code>models/Orders::add_item()</code> to do useful stuff.</p>
        <p>This method is invoked when a menu picture is clicked on. 
            You can see that by mousing over any of the menu item images 
            and observing the target link in the bottom left of your browser window.</p>
        <p>If all goes well, clicking on an item will add it to the order
            and redisplay the menu. The only evidence of this will be that
            the order total is updated.</p>
        <p>At this point, with no logic behind the handling method,
            clicking on an item appears to do nothing, which is quite
            correct!</p>

    <slide title="Let's Start to Fix the Handling" layout="normal">
        <p>This method is invoked when a menu picture is clicked on.

        <p>
            <code>Order::add</code> needs to properly update the <code>orderitems</code> 
            table to reflect the request.
            In theory, the logic to do this could be in a controller 
            (interpreting it as business logic), or in a 
            model (interpreting it as model logic). 
            Given the "model adapter" strategy that PHP frameworks favor, 
            it makes most sense to deal with the logic inside the model, 
            reducing the coupling between the controller and model layers.</p>

        <div class="left">
            <p>
                <code>Order::add(num,item)</code> then becomes just a facade for 
                calling the related model method, <code>models/Orders::add_item(...)</code>. 
                These have similar names to reinforce the connection between them.</p>
            <p>So, the controller fix (line 50 fixme) is simply 
                <code>$this-&gt;orders-&gt;add_item($order_num,$item)</code>.</p>

    <slide title="Order Additions - Orderitems?" layout="normal">
        <p>The add_item method in the orders model now needs to be completed.
            There, you need to see if that item is part of the order already, 
            in which case retrieve its record, 
            increment the quantity and then update the table. 
            If it isn't already there, you will need to make 
            an empty orderitem record, and populate its fields 
            appropriately (including setting the quantity to 1), 
            before adding that record to the table.</p>   
        <p>The <code>Orderitems</code> model is not referenced inside any 
            controller. I did this on purpose, hoping that you would conclude 
            that such references belong in the Orders model. 
            In the Orders model, you will need to get a handle to the CodeIgniter 
            instance, in order to reference the Orderitems model, because of O-O scoping. 
            Even if autoloaded, Orderitems would be a property of the controller 
            object, and out of scope inside a model object. </p>

            <p>The idea, inside <code>models/Orders</code>, is shown to the right.</p>
            <p>If you made the earlier design decision to keep an order's total 
                continuously updated, then you would have
                that method here. Otherwise, you are done.</p>

    <slide title="Order Additions - Ideal Treatment?" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>Order additions should now work, with the order total updating
                as you click on items to add to an order.</p>
            <p>An ideal implementation would have some domain/entity classes, 
                specifically a <code>domain/Order</code> to deal with the logic here that 
                might feel awkward in a controller or in a conventional orders 
                model, which is part of the data access layer and not an entity 
                encapsulation.</p>
            <p>In hindsight, it might have been kinder to you 
                to follow this strategy, even if it meant a more complex 
                starter app â€“ O-O cohesion could have been better.</p>
