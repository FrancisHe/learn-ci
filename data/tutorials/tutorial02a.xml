        <p>This tutorial will walk you through working with a shared
            repository.</p>
        <p>The goal is to add your name to the appropriate list, in the
            appropriate order, on the 
            <a href="https://github.com/comp4711/winter2015-students">Winter 
                2015 Students</a> list.
        </p>
        <p>That can't be so hard, can it? &lt;-- said with a straight face.</p>
        <p>Suggestion: you may want to skim the slideshow first,
            before working your way through it.</p>

        <div class="left">
            <p>Many projects insist that submitted code be "signed", so they
                can be assured of the identity of the contributer.</p>
            <p>The first part of this is making sure that Git is
                configured with your name and email. This might be doable
                through your IDE, or you might have to use the command
                prompt, shown right.</p>

            <p> Many projects insist that submitted code be "signed", so they
                can be assured of the identity of the contributer.</p>
            <p>This signoff might be acceptable for many projects, but some 
                will insist that commits be "digitally signed".

            <p>The first time you do this, you will need to add the remote
                repository, and you should call it "upstream".</p>

            <p>Select the "Compare &amp; pull request" link.</p>
            <p>Near the top of the page, it should say that the pull
                request can be automaticaly merged. If it doesn't,
                you did something wrong.</p>
            <p>Scroll down to the bottom of the page displayed, and make 
                sure that the changes are what you expect.</p>
            <p>If all looks ok, click "Create pull request".</p>

    <slide title="Wait For It..." layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>At this point, you should see the main repository,
                with your pull request center screen.</p>
            <p>You can comment on it, but you will have to wait for the repo
                maintainer to merge or reject your pull request.</p>

    <slide title="Waiting For It?" layout="normal">
        <div class="left">
            <p>The maintainer is likely not waiting with baited breath
                for your specific change. You will probably work on something
                else, and then revisit the main repo site to see what is
                happening.</p>
            <p>If your pull request is still in progress, it will be
                in the queue of requests.</p>

        </div>
    </slide>

    <slide title="Are We Done Yet?" layout="normal">
        <p>Your pull request might get rejected for any number of reasons.
            You will get an email explaining the decision.</p>
        <p>Once your pull request has been merged, resynchronize
            your "master" branch with the "upstream" repo,
            and you can delete the topic branch on your github repo and
            locally.</p>
        <p>This probably sounds like a lot of work, but it will
            start to come naturally to you, and you will appreciate
            the wisdom of shared code management, and some of the steps
            here, once you have two or more developers sharing a repository!</p>
